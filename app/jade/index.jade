                p "The Aquaphase washer minimised closure of superbug infected ward as our medical equipment and furniture could be decontaminated and turned around within 24hours. Something that would need days under manual decontaminationÂ costing "the"hospital "vast" sums" in "lost"bed" days,"and"staff"and"patient"disruption."

                p "Investing in a washer disinfector employing chemical disinfection has increased our equipment life cycle as opposed to thermal disinfection which has a negative effect of damage to equipment surfaces, hence cost savings from reducing condemned equipment."

                p "Jet washes and manual decontamination seemed effective until we employed an automated washer disinfector which meant we could validate reproduce washes. With the Aquaphase, we were also able to quantify and regulate our utility usage."
